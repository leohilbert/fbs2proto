# [WIP] Flatbuffer to Protobuf converter
a simple binary to convert a flatbuffer to a protobuf-file

# This is my very first go-project, so please don't judge! :)
After using flatbuffers for a while now, I want to move back to protobuf.  
I haven't found a way to convert them without going through each message individually and since I'm lazy I wanted the computer to do it for me and learn some go in the process.

This will probably not convert everything 100% correctly and you will need to modify a few parts, but it's a start, so you don't have to start from scratch.
